# **MathSolver**

## **About the Project**

**MathSolver** is an innovative application that combines advanced artificial intelligence and image processing technologies to solve mathematical problems. Use your photographs to solve complex mathematical equations, thereby facilitating your learning process.

## **Features**

- **Solve Problems with Photos:** Use photos taken with your mobile phone or selected from your album to solve mathematical problems.
- **Advanced Cropping Tools:** Crop your photos as desired using the **TCROP** library.
- **MathPix Integration:** Convert problems in photos to **LaTeX** format for clear and understandable solutions.
- **Visual Presentation with MathJax:** Display solutions in a visual and understandable format on **WebView** using **MathJax**.
- **History Recording:** Save all your queries and solutions using **CoreData**.
- **In-App Purchases:** Perform in-app purchase transactions with **Adapty** integration.
- **Network Communication with Alamofire:** Manage API requests using **Alamofire**, a Swift-based HTTP networking library.

## **Technologies & Tools**

MathSolver leverages a variety of advanced technologies and tools to deliver a comprehensive and user-friendly experience:

- **MathPix:** Utilizes the MathPix API to detect mathematical expressions in photographs and convert them to LaTeX format.
- **ChatGPT:** Employs the ChatGPT API for understanding user queries and performing natural language processing.
- **TCROP:** Incorporates the TCROP library for custom image cropping.
- **MathJax:** Integrates the MathJax library to visually render LaTeX formatted mathematical expressions.
- **CoreData:** Uses CoreData, iOS's native database management system, for local storage of historical queries and solutions.
- **Adapty:** Integrates the Adapty platform for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions.
- **Alamofire:** Uses Alamofire for network communication and API requests.
- **Programmatic UI:** The app is developed using programmatic UI techniques for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Postman:** Utilized for API testing and endpoint management.

# MathSolver

## About the Project
MathSolver is an innovative application that combines advanced artificial intelligence and image processing technologies to solve mathematical problems. You can solve complex mathematical equations using your photographs, facilitating your learning process.

# Features
Solve Problems with Photos: Use photos taken with your mobile phone or selected from your album to solve mathematical problems.
Advanced Cropping Tools: Crop your photos as desired using the TCROP library.

MathPix Integration: Convert problems in photos to LaTeX format for clear and understandable solutions.

Visual Presentation with MathJax: Display solutions in a visual and understandable format on WebView using MathJax.

History Recording: Save all your queries and solutions using CoreData.

In-App Purchases: Perform in-app purchase transactions with Adapty integration.

Network Communication with Alamofire: Manage API requests using Alamofire, a Swift-based HTTP networking library.

MathPix: Utilizes the MathPix API for detecting mathematical expressions in photographs and converting them to LaTeX format.

ChatGPT: Employs the ChatGPT API for understanding user queries and performing natural language processing.

TCROP: Incorporates the TCROP library for custom image cropping according to user requirements.

MathJax: Integrates the MathJax library to render LaTeX formatted mathematical expressions visually appealing in a web environment.

CoreData: Uses CoreData, iOS's native database management system, for locally storing user's historical queries and solutions.

Adapty: Adapty platform is integrated for managing in-app purchases and simplifying subscriptions.

Alamofire: Alamofire, a Swift-based HTTP networking library, is used for network communication and API requests.

Programmatic UI: The app is developed using programmatic UI techniques, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Postman: Postman has been utilized for API testing and endpoint management, ensuring robust and reliable API integration.
